## Overview

At YLD we believe that in the future all companies will be software companies, and we are now seeing this transformation taking place across the business world. Do you want to be a part of making that transformation for our clients, some of the most successful FTSE-100 companies? Help define the future; today.

As an Engagement Lead at YLD, you will be the key figure that leads our digital transformation engagements from within our customer's businesses. You will help assemble and then lead a team of developers of the highest calibre. You will be a key figure within YLD and help to inform our strategy as we continue to grow, as well as ensuring YLD stays on the cutting edge of technology.

## YLD!

YLD’s speciality is in digital transformations for Enterprise companies, helping them to transform their business into software companies: the companies of the future. This involves transformation not just of the development team but of the entire process from business conception to software delivery. YLD is a strong proponent of continuous delivery and rigorous testing, and we help our customers to move towards this from long, slow release cycles. YLD firmly believes that companies that do not make this transformation will not survive the changes in the way that business is conducted today and in the future, and we enable them to make that transformation with minimal risk.

YLD have offices in London and Lisbon and our customers are largely London-based FTSE-100 companies in the travel, retail, e-commerce and publishing sectors.

YLD’s approach to Enterprise digital transformations is unique; we educate (through both workshops and pair-programming), co-develop, and automate, thereby up-skilling our customer's development teams, helping them to attract new talent through open-source contributions and promotion and evangelism in the developer community. We also offer on-going support and SLAs.

Despite being a young company, our founders and senior consultants’ pedigree includes Nodejitsu, Sony Computer Entertainment and Clock, and have worked with high-profile clients such as British Gas, Skype, TES, Lamassu and others including a number of FTSE-100 companies.

We have a strong focus on testing and continuous delivery methodologies, instilling the same in our customers’ development teams, and prefer to work in cross-discipline, self-sufficient, vertical teams made up of a mix of YLD and client developers and DevOps engineers. We combine the latest open source technologies together with traditional Enterprise software products.

## The Role

A YLD Engagement Lead is someone with a deep, technical understanding of the technologies in which we specialise, yet who also has the business acumen and communication skills to both steer a development team and act as an intermediary between them and the client stakeholders such as their Project Manager and Head of Development. They are first and foremost a developer and should have the experience to match.

You will be instrumental in delivering transformation projects at FTSE-100 companies that are seeking to move from legacy or monolithic enterprise service layers to a backend that allows their product teams to be more nimble and better able to respond to the changing landscape of today’s technology industry.

You will lead such projects from an initial assessment, through assembling a team and aiding YLD’s Chief Architect, EVP of Professional Services and Head of Training to produce proposals, to arranging training and co-developing solutions for our clients to make this transition safely and without disrupting their existing service. You will report to the EVP of Professional Services, who heads up the consulting arm of YLD.

A successful Engagement Lead is not simply a manager, coordinator or account manager, but is in fact the most experienced developer across the gamut of disciplines relevant to the project. This may include, but is not limited to, back-end Node.js, front-end (e.g. React, Angular or similar), architecture and a strong focus on testing, code coverage and continuous delivery; exposure to DevOps skills is a bonus.

You will be expected to work on-site during various customer engagements, building relationships with key customer stakeholders, and identifying and closing additional sales opportunities with the customer’s business.

You would work with multiple customers over time, but would generally focus on one at a time. You would generally work on-site, but along-side YLD engineers also engaged with the customer.

You would be consulted on architectural, performance and delivery, yet have the support of your engineers and other YLD colleagues in providing the required expertise. Whilst not a project manager or Agile specialist, you would be expected to have some experience and understanding of these disciplines.

You will liaise with some of the highest levels of vendor-focused management within our customers’ organisation, and hence you will be well presented and possess excellent communication skills.

You will have a real passion for software development. Well-qualified candidates will have contributed to open source projects, have participated in some technical community or interest group or have written or spoken in public about their technical ideas. Despite being highly experienced, an Engagement Lead at YLD will still be an active learner - tinkering with new open source libraries, using unfamiliar technologies without a lot of supervision and learning new programming languages in their spare time, etc. Lastly, the individual would also have a strong understanding of key Agile engineering practices to guide senior client IT leaders on improvement opportunities in their engineering practices.

## Desired Skills

The Engagement Lead would have an excellent knowledge of many of the following web development technologies: Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, various front-end frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Backbone) and an understanding of the principles of back-end architecture, scalability and deployments (even if in languages other than Node.js); .NET and Java are considered advantageous.

Engineering practices such as pair programming, continuous integration, test driven development, and incremental design should be second nature to the Engagement Lead, whether that be with Mocha, Protractor, Karma, Selenium or JUnit. A pragmatic understanding of the “test pyramid” is paramount and writing code without tests should be unimaginable. At the same time, a successful candidate will not only be a good learner, but a good teacher. They should inspire their peers and more junior team members to learn and expand their skill set, guiding them in the right direction and growing them into more effective YLD consultants.
